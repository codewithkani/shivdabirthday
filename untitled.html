      Dear Shivda,<br></br>
      First of all, a very Happy Birthday to you, my little one. üéâ
      Today is a celebration of someone whose presence in this world‚Äîand in my life‚Äîmeans more than words could ever express. You have the kind of heart that not only feels deeply but also heals quietly. You may not always see it, but the warmth you carry inside you makes the world a better place for those lucky enough to be around you.<br></br>

     I hope this birthday brings you all the happiness you deserve, multiplied a thousand times. I pray that every single one of your dreams turns into reality, that your smile never fades, and that your heart always stays as kind and sensitive as it is. May life only offer you the kind of love and care that you give to others so selflessly.<br></br>
   But while I celebrate you today, I also want to own up to something I‚Äôve carried in my heart for a long time‚Äîa deep regret. I‚Äôm truly sorry for faking my face in the beginning. I know I should have trusted you enough to show you the real me, but fear and insecurity clouded my judgment. I was scared of being seen and maybe not being accepted. But still, it was wrong. You didn‚Äôt deserve that dishonesty, and I can‚Äôt tell you how much guilt I‚Äôve felt for not being real from the start<br></br> 
    Despite all that, you still chose to give me another chance. That‚Äôs the kind of person you are‚Äîso beautifully forgiving, so incredibly rare. I can‚Äôt thank you enough for that. I‚Äôm endlessly grateful for your patience, for seeing beyond the surface, and for still choosing to believe in me even when I made it hard to.<br></br>
 Your heart is the most precious part of you, and I promise never to take it for granted again. If there‚Äôs one thing I want to give you on your birthday besides good wishes and smiles, it‚Äôs my sincere promise‚Äîthat I will always be there. In the quiet moments, in the loud celebrations, in every storm and every sunshine‚ÄîI‚Äôll stand beside you. Not as someone perfect, but as someone real. Someone who sees the light in you and wants nothing more than to protect it.<br></br>

No matter what paths life takes us on, please know this: I‚Äôm not going anywhere. You will always have me‚Äîsomeone who respects you, cherishes you, and feels lucky every single day just to know you.<br></br>

So here‚Äôs to you, your growth, your laughter, your quiet strength, and the beauty you bring into every space you enter.<br></br>
And as I always call you‚Äîwith all my love and a heart full of honesty‚Äî<br></br>
Happy birthday, my little one. üíó<br></br>

 Forever yours,<br></br>
  Kanha
